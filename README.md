DESCRIPTION- This project involves building a program that predicts stock prices based on historical data. The program uses machine learning algorithms to analyze past stock prices and make predictions about future stock prices

Libraries Used:	TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy


Process:	 Use TensorFlow library to build a machine learning model for stock price prediction and use Pandas and NumPy libraries for data preprocessing and analysis.
